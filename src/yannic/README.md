yannic_robot:

on branch beta:

try to incorporate the feature from arduino_robot_pkg. Here motor controls work but no feedback from the feedback line. Changed urdf to be my model instead of the stls

yannic_robot_moveit_config:

demo.launch works well with rosserial -> next step transfer actual joint states through feedback line with float_array
